Hi! I am Kun Li (李琨). 

I am now a Researcher in Systems and Networking Research Group, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/">Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)</a> since Jul. 2022. My research interests include large-scale parallel computing, high performance deep learning systems, and heterogeneous computing. Before joining MSRA, I was a Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.ucas.ac.cn/">University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>(中国科学院大学), advised by Prof. Yunquan Zhang. Also, I was a student at State Key Lab of Computer Architecture in Institute of Computing Technology(中科院计算所计算机体系结构国家重点实验室), where I did my research work. 

I also love Chinese painting, reading, and taking photos. I am always willing to try all new things, and keeping to learn from them.
